Hey there! I'm just a typical software developer from Canada. I usually spend my time in learning new (to me!) technologies and absorbing enough knowledge to get by. I'm a terrible designer so I just don't get front end frameworks, but that doesn't stop me from learning and trying new things. I currently work on enterprise resource planning systems for my job, but enjoy working with CS:GO (Sourcepawn), APIs (Node.js), and some small work with 3DS hardware/software (C/C++).  
If you would like, feel free to contact me on Twitter, email, or the various socials on my site! I'm always willing to help as much as I can!ðŸ¤™
